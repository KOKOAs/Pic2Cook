## Background and introducation  
The reason why I conducted this research is that during the special period like now when everyone stay at home, It was a very troublesome to decide what to cook at home everyday for everyone, and It is not very convenient to buy vegetables outside. So this application with food ingredient recognition and dishes recommend functions can allow user to decide what to cook with the ingredient have already have at home very quickly and convenient.
